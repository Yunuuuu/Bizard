The pyramid chart is a pyramid-like figure that distributes data on both sides of a central axis.

## Setup

-   System Requirements: Cross-platform (Linux/MacOS/Windows)

-   Programming language: R

-   Dependent packages: `ggcharts`

```{r packages setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output=FALSE}
# Install packages
if (!requireNamespace("ggcharts", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("ggcharts")
}

# Load packages
library(ggcharts)
```

## Data Preparation

The loaded data are age, gender, and the number of people after the combination of the first two variables .

```{r load data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load data
data <- read.delim("files/Hiplot/144-pyramid-chart-data.txt", header = T)

# View data
head(data)
```

## Visualization

```{r fig-1pyramid-chart}
#| label: fig-1pyramid-chart
#| fig-cap: "Pyramid Chart"
#| out.width: "95%"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 4
#| warning: false
#| error: false
#| message: false

# Pyramid Chart
p <- pyramid_chart(data = data, x = age, y = pop, group = sex, 
                   title = "", sort = "no", bar_colors = c("#C20B01","#196ABD")) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Arial"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12,hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5,vjust = 1),
        legend.position = "right",
        legend.direction = "vertical",
        legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10))

p
```

The graph shows the age groups from bottom to top in order on the central axis, the left side represents the number of men, the right side represents the number of women, and the X-axis represents the number of people. The graph clearly shows the proportion of men and women in different age groups and the proportion of different age groups in the same gender.
