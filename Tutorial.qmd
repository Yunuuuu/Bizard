As a comprehensive visual code repository for community collaboration, Bizard is a platform based on GitHub that integrates **question answering**, **graph collection**, **collaborative development**, and **automated deployment**. Community members can discuss challenges through `GitHub Discussions`, initiate new diagrams through `GitHub Issues`, contribute through `GitHub Pull Requests`, and automate website deployment using `GitHub Actions`. The following describes each step in detail:

## Discussion Questions

`GitHub Discussions` is a forum-like platform that provides a relaxed and open space for project communication. In Bizard, we built a website comment system based on giscus, which is located at the bottom of the website page:

Discuss Questions Using The Bizard Comment System
:::

If you have problems with any of the graphic tutorials, you can start a discussion using the comment box at the bottom of the tutorial page. To do so, you need to log in to your GitHub account and edit your question using Markdown syntax.

Once you submit a comment, your question will be automatically announced in the GitHub Discussions section of the Bizard project repository and marked with a link to the graphic tutorial. Any community member who sees your question can contribute to the discussion, and the Bizard operations team will regularly respond to questions in GitHub Discussions.

## Graphics Collection

Bizard is always looking for new graphics from the community. You can submit them through `GitHub Issues`. The following information is required when submitting:

- Proposed Graphic Name
- Graphic Category: Basics / Clinical / Omics
- Graphic Example
- Related Resources: Graphic-Related Links

Reference example: [New Graphic Collection (First Issue)](https://github.com/openbiox/Bizard/issues/61)

GitHub Issues Collect New Graphics
:::

After submitting GitHub Issues, the Bizard operations team will review the chart. The review results include the following three categories:

1. Project not yet considered
2. Supplement to existing graphic tutorials
3. Add new graphic tutorials

Once approved, you can provide a tutorial with images and text via GitHub Issues or Pull Requests. If you are unable to provide a tutorial, the Bizard operations team will assign someone else to handle it.

## Collaborative Development

All community members can participate in the development of the Bizard project through `GitHub Pull Requests`, such as contributing new graphic tutorials, optimizing the website layout, etc.

Before contributing a new tutorial via Pull Request, we recommend submitting a GitHub Issue. The Bizard Operations Team will review the tutorial and provide suggestions for revisions. If you are unable to submit a Pull Request, the Bizard Operations Team will assign someone else to submit it.

Graphic tutorials should be written in accordance with Bizard's formatting standards and should include the following:

- Graphic Description
- Example
- Setup
- Data Preparation
- Visualization
- Application
- Reference

Reference example:
- [New graphic tutorial (Omics - Multiple volcano Plot)](https://github.com/openbiox/Bizard/issues/75)
- [Issue 1 (Omics/MultiVolcanoPlot)](https://github.com/openbiox/Bizard/pull/133)

## Automated deployment

To ensure efficient and reliable website development and completely eliminate the tediousness, delays, and risk of human error associated with manual website updates, Bizard has built a comprehensive automated workflow using `GitHub Actions`. This fully automates the entire process from code submission to website deployment, significantly improving the agility and stability of website iterations. The workflow is as follows: When a developer pushes new website content or code updates to a designated master branch (such as main or master) or initiates a pull request, GitHub Actions is automatically activated. It immediately executes a series of key tasks within a clean virtual environment provided by GitHub, strictly following a pre-defined configuration file (Workflow File), building the website and automatically deploying it to GitHub Pages.
